    "> [nbdoc](https://github.com/outerbounds/nbdoc) is a lightweight version of [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev) that allows you to create rich, testable content with notebooks.  [Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a beautiful static site generator for code documentation and blogging.  This project brings all of these together to give you a powerful documentation system."

    "Writing technical documentation can be an ardous process.  Many projects have no documentation at all, and if they do they are often stale or out of date.  Our goal is to make writing documentation as easy as possible by providing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **Authoring experience that encourages the creation** of quality documentation: (1) Write & run code in-situ - avoid copy & pasting code (2) WSYIWG or low-latency hot-reload experience so you can get immediate feedback on how your docs will look.\n",
    "- [x] **Testing**: Automated testing of code snippets\n",
    "- [x] **Unified Search**: Unified search across API docs, tutorials, how-to guides, user guides with a great user interface that helps users understand the source of each\n",
    "- [x] Allow you to **highlight specific lines of code.**\n",
    "- [x] Allow authors to **hide** cell inputs, outputs or both\n",
    "- [ ] **Entity Linking**: Detect entities like modules and class names in backticks and automatically link those to the appropriate documentation.\n",
    "- [ ] **Inline and side-by-side explanations** (pop-ups, two-column view, etc)\n",
    "- [ ] Allow reader to **collapse/show** code and output\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "The unchecked items are a work in progress.  There are some tools that offer some of these features such as [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), but we wanted more flexibility with regards to the static site generator and desired additional features not available on those platforms."

    "**For this tutorial to make the most sense, you should view this notebook and the rendered doc side-by-side.  This page is called \"Authoring Guide\" and is the default page at the root when you start the site.**  This tutorial assumes you have some familiarity with static site generators, if you do not, please visit the [Docusarus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs).\n",

    "\n",
    "You can create a notebook in any directory.  When you do this, an associated markdown file is automatically generated with the same name in the same location.  For example `intro.ipynb` generates `intro.md`.  For pages that are created with a notebook, you should always edit them in a notebook.  The markdown that is generated can be useful for debugging, but should not be directly edited a warning message is present in auto-generated markdown files.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using notebooks in the first place is optional. You can create Markdown files as you normally would to create pages.  We recommend using notebooks whenever possible, as you can embed arbitrary Markdown in notebooks, and also use `raw cells` for things like front matter or MDX components. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Front Matter & MDX\n",
    "\n",
    "The first cell of your notebook should be a `raw` cell with the appropriate front-matter.  For example, this notebook has the following front matter:\n",

    "### Python Scripts In Docs\n",

    "If you use the `%%writefile` magic, the magic command will get stripped from the cell, and the cell will be annotated with the appropriate filename as a title to denote that the cell block is referencing a script.  Furthermore, any outputs are removed when you use this magic command."
